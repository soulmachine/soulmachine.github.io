In my previous blog, I explained how to [Create a Hadoop Compilation and Development Environment](http://www.soulmachine.me/blog/2015/01/29/create-a-hadoop-compilation-and-development-environment/) so that you can build the Hadoop source code you get from the Apache Hadoop git repository.

However, not everyone need to dig into the source code, normally more people will just call the Hadoop APIs to write a MapReduce program. When you write a MapReduce program, you rarely get it right for one time, then you need to debug your code.
 
This time I'll show you how to debug your Hadoop applications using the IntelliJ IDE.
